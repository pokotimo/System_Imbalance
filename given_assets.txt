Assume I have a given system imbalance which is 500 MW. I have the following assets which I can use to regulate the system imbalance.
Asset A:
- control range: +- 300 MW
- speed of change: 2 MW/ timestep
Asset B:
- control range: +- 150
- speed of change: 15 MW/ timestep
Asset C:
- control range: +- 125
- speed of change: 25 MW/ timestep
Asset D:
- control range: +-125
- speed of change: 250 MW/timestep

I want to react to the given system imbalance. I want to minimize the system imbalance by setting up each asset for each timestep as optimal as possible
